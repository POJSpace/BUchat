# BUChat

** This is a vulnerable application designed to be used for basic pentesting training. ** 

## Lore

BUChat (short for: "Břeňkuv Úžasny Chat") was an application developed by a certain system administrator, that was sick of all the existing solutions. <br>
However, since he did not know much programming and was quite lazy, he used a very esoteric tech-stack and made some crutial security mistakes. Can you spot them?
